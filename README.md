# Reverse-Engineering the Retrieval Process in GenIR Models

This is the repository for our project "Reverse-Engineering the Retrieval Process in GenIR Models". The analysis code will be uploaded shortly, code for training and evaluation can be found in the directory `code`. The website for our paper is hosted [here](https://technion-cs-nlp.github.io/re-gen-ir/index.html).

## Code
